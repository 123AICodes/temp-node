### NODE JS

Node uses CommonJS

_GLOBAL VARIABLES_
In node there's no window but there is the concept of _global variables_. The _global variables_ are;

1. \_\_dirname: Path to the current directory
2. \_\_filename: File name.
3. require: Function to use module (Common JS).
4. module: Info about current module(file)
5. process: Info about env where the program is being executed.

_MODULES_
Modules are encapsulated code (only share minimum);
